The home page for this assignment is:

https://personal-sites.deakin.edu.au/~edwinj/780/assignment1/index.html

The api is located in the folder named "api":
https://personal-sites.deakin.edu.au/~edwinj/780/assignment1/api/create.php
https://personal-sites.deakin.edu.au/~edwinj/780/assignment1/api/read.php
https://personal-sites.deakin.edu.au/~edwinj/780/assignment1/api/update.php
https://personal-sites.deakin.edu.au/~edwinj/780/assignment1/api/delete.php

The curl consumed php pages are located at

https://personal-sites.deakin.edu.au/~edwinj/780/assignment1/create-api.php
https://personal-sites.deakin.edu.au/~edwinj/780/assignment1/read-api.php
https://personal-sites.deakin.edu.au/~edwinj/780/assignment1/update-api.php
https://personal-sites.deakin.edu.au/~edwinj/780/assignment1/delete-api.php

In case a different server needs to be used:

1) copy the contents of "assignment1" folder.
2) modify each php file in the api folder by entering your own database credentials.
3) modify each curl consumed php pages (create-api.php, read-api.php etc..) by changing the path in the url.
4) run index.html in the server.
